## Introduction

I am currently working as a research assistant at [Rotman FinHub](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/ResearchCentres/FinHub){:target="_blank"} @ University of Toronto. My research focus on financial applications of machine learning techniques. We use NLP to understand market movement and uncertainty with news media, use Reinforcement Learning to hedge financial derivatives, and use Variational Auto-Encoders to model evolutions of implied volatility surfaces.
