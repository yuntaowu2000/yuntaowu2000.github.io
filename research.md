## Introduction

I am currently working as a research assistant at [Rotman FinHub](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/ResearchCentres/FinHub){:target="_blank"} at University of Toronto. My research focus on financial applications of machine learning techniques. To begin with, we employ NLP methodologies to analyze news text and earnings announcements. This approach enables us to quantify market uncertainty and explain post-announcement returns. Secondly, we leverage Variational Auto-Encoders to model the evolutions of implied volatility surfaces and asset prices.
