## Introduction

I am currently working as a research assistant at [Rotman FinHub](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/ResearchCentres/FinHub){:target="_blank"} @ University of Toronto. My research focus on financial applications of machine learning techniques. We use NLP to predict returns on company & sector levels, Reinforcement Learning to hedge financial derivatives, and use Variational Auto-Encoders to generate implied volatility surfaces.
